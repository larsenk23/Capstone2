### This capstone project is on Google Analytics Transaction Predictions. 

The goal is to use data from the Google Merchandise Store to predict whether a user will make a purchase. 

The project was to be completed within a given timeframe. My next step after completing this project will be to build a model that predicts the revenue of the customers who make purchases.
